This is a research project on the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows. The main element is a program which searches for near-optimal solutions using a heuristic. It can optimize VRPTW tasks which are formatted according to rules described here:

Apart from the optimizing engine, there are a few tools to organize the obtained results or to visualize some aspects of them. There is a local copy of best known results, available at the page mentioned above. Some functions are accessible through a GUI.

The publication of these sources is for facilitating collaboration on this project by my colleagues; it is possible that other researchers could benefit from it, as a reference for their work. I plan to implement some of the algorithms described in papers about VRPTW. The primary goal is to test different solution methods, the efficiency of the algorithms is a secondary objective.
